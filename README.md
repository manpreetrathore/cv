Help me make a horrible portfolio by letting people from all over the world contribute with their own ideas and design!

If you have any questions or any requests, feel free to message me!
By the way, following articles and tutorials will guide you to create complete and correct pull requests.

_Disclaimer! This is a project for fun! at the same time I  expect a decent standard website . I expect the community to give me a nice portfolio and that we will have fun creating it together_

## What to do:
- Make a portfolio website with my info. You can add whatever folder/files you want to add.

### Don't

- No spam! Small contributions like minor styling or spell correction are accepted but obvious spam for the t-shirt will be labeled invalid.
- Don't use prettier/auto indent/ auto format because it will create HUGE merge conflicts
- Do NOT add any build steps e.g. npm install (I want to keep this a simple static site).

### Do

- Keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts.
- Make sure there is no merge conflict
- Fun things! This is not supposed to be serious or pretty. Be creative add easter eggs and pink stuff! 🐷
